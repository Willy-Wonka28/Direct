   - A React-based UI that lets users connect wallets, initiate payments, and track transaction status.
2. **Backend** (`backend/`)
   - An Express.js server that processes transactions, integrates with Solana Web3.js, and handles fiat transactions via Squad API.
3. **Smart Contract** (`smart-contract/`)
   - A Solana smart contract (written in Rust via Seahorse) that ensures the integrity of crypto transactions.
